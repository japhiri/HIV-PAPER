# HIV PAPER
 This project explores the impact of HIV infection on nasal immunity. The project recruited 18-45 year old HIV- adults, PLHIV on ART for les than 3 months and PLHIV on ART for more than one year. Nasal cells were collected using nasal curette, nasal lining fluid using nasosorption filter. We also collected paired peripheral blood. Flow cytometry based immunophenotyping of nasal cells and peripheral blood, single cell RNA sequencing of nasal cells was performed to profile the transcriptional landscape in immune and epithelial cells. ELISA and bead-based cytokine analysis usinng MSD platform were used to profile nasal lining flud soluble factors.
