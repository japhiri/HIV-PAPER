# HIV PAPER
 This project explores the impact of HIV infection on nasal immunity. The project recruited 18-45 year old HIV- adults, PLHIV on ART for les than 3 months and PLHIV on ART for more than one year. Flow cytometry based immunophenotyping and single cell RNA sequencing of nasal cells collected from the inferior turbinate using a nasal curette was performed.
