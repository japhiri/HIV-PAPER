**Abstract**

Despite systemic viral suppression, people living with HIV (PLHIV) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) remain highly susceptible to pneumococcal colonisation and disease. Here, we show that long-term ART does not restore nasal mucosal immunity. Using flow cytometry, single-cell transcriptomics, and neutrophil function assays, we identified a persistent mucosal immune signature in PLHIV-ART>1yr marked by epithelial-driven neutrophilic inflammation, T cell exhaustion, and cellular senescence. Neutrophils exhibited mitochondrial stress, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) gene expression, and impaired oxidative burst, particularly in individuals with pneumococcal carriage. Epithelial cells expressed elevated neutrophil-recruiting ligand genes, while nasal T cells displayed pro-apoptotic and exhaustion gene profiles. Neutrophilic inflammation was strongly associated with pneumococcal carriage density, implicating a feedforward loop between inflammation and microbial persistence. Our findings reveal tissue-specific immune dysregulation despite ART and suggest that targeting epithelial-immune signalling or neutrophil senescence may offer therapeutic avenues to reduce respiratory pathogen burden in PLHIV.
